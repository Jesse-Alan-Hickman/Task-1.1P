                        <p>In 2022, I created a responsive web application called 'My Baby's Name' as part of SIT120: Introduction to Responsive Web Applications. The aim of the website was to provide a tool for expecting couples to easily search, favourite, and review potential baby names based on gender. The idea for this application came from my own experience, as I was expecting a child at the time, and thought it would be handy to have a tool like this. This web applcation was build using the Vue.js framework; a progressive JavaScript that focuses on simplicity and ease of integration for developers.</p>

                        <p>In 2019, I assisted in the creation of a website called 'MedicalTech' as part of SIT104: Exploring Information Technology. This website focused on providing users with information in regards to emerging technologies, specifically in the medical sector. THe website was created as part of a group project, where each member contributed towards it's creation via HTML, CSS, a JS.</p>
